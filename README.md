## ⚡️ Quick start

First of all, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Java**. Version `8.0` or higher is required, along with [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html). 

Once both are installed, download the repository and open it using NetBeans.

### ServerPanel GUI
From the `Server` folder launch `ServerPanel.java`. The GUI provides information about server port, connected users, connection requests, messages, and disconnected users.


### User connect GUI
Once the server is live, users can connect using the `GUI.java` from the `Client` folder. This GUI allows the users to input an ID (must be unique) and name, then connect to the server.

### User message GUI
After that users can use the application to send messages to all users connected to the server.
